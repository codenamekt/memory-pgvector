"""writer.py — async write queue for the pgvector memory plugin.
#
# Forked from andreab67/hermes-memory-pgvector (BSD-3-Clause).
#
# Decouples `on_memory_write` from the (potentially slow) embed + INSERT
# path. Built-in memory tool fires the hook → we enqueue → background
# thread drains, embeds, writes. The hook returns in microseconds, never
# blocks the agent loop on a slow embed endpoint.

Failure modes we deliberately swallow:
  • queue full              → drop write, log once, set a tripwire flag
  • embed endpoint slow/down → write goes through with embedding=NULL,
                              row is still recoverable, recall just
                              misses it until a future backfill
  • DB temporarily down     → drop write, log once
  • background thread crash → log + auto-restart on next enqueue

The whole point is to avoid the Honcho-style retry-storm meltdown.
